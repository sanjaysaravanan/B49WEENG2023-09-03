  Promise:
    Object to understand the completion(or failure) of an asynchronous event/operation

    MDN-> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise

    State:
      pending --->  initial state, neither fulfilled(success) nor rejected(failure).

      fullfilled ---> meaning that the operation was completed successfully with a value

      rejected ---> meaning that the operation failed with a reason

    methods:
      then ---> executed when the promise is fullfilled/resolved
      catch ---> executed when the promise is rejected/unfullfilled
    
    Chaining --> returning an promise from resolvement in parent promise
      execution time --> sum of time taken by all promise chains
    All --> Independent Promise triggered simultaneously/parallel
      execution: Maximum time among promises
    Any --> trigger independent promises
      resolve is success when any one is resolved

  Fetch & then
    Fetch -> Interface to make an api call
      then ---> response --> convert response to json -> promsie .then (json -> operation on json)
  
  Session Task:
    use fetch and get the data from the below url,
    https://api.disneyapi.dev/character

    Print the array of disney characters
  
  Async/Await:

    avoid chaining of promises, synchronous execution promises

      async --> implies we are carring an async operation inside a function
      await --> waiting for the promise to get resolved

  1. Publics APIs
    Look for You requirement & Choose a type of API
    Use APIs which has HTTPS 
    If Signing is fine Go for Auth, HTTPS, CORS enabled

    Read the Documentation Test the API before choosing it

  2. Implementation of DOM manipulation examples
    1. Email Verify examples
    2. Get City weather examples

  3. Design Ideas, https://spicey-hut.netlify.app/recipe.html, https://shoppingcart-spicyhut.netlify.app/#header

  intro to public APIs ---> Choose public APIs based on the API_key, Https, Cors
